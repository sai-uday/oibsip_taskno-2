            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and
            statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram,
            Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. <br>He spent the next four decades as a scientist
            and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian
            Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and
            missile development efforts.He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
            development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.He also played a pivotal organisational,
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original
            nuclear test by India in 1974.
            <br>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and
            the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6] he returned to his
            civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious
            awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
